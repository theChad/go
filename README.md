# go

Bare-bones implemntation of a local go game. Allows placement of stones and enforces turn order, but will not enforce the ko rule or do any scoring (nor allow passing yet). Likely never will - this was just a hobby project. 

## Installation

Created using lein, and can be run using `lein run`.

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    $ lein run
    
## Options

Board size..but unfinished, as with the rest of the project. `lein run 9` will restrict plays to the upper left 9x9, and capture stones as if playing on a smaller board, but still draws the big board.
