# Local-play Go

This is a basic implementation of a local-play go game. It allows placement of stones and enforces turn order, but will not enforce the ko rule or do any scoring (nor allow passing yet). This project started out as in clojure, on the desktop, but I've since migrated to clojurescript in the browser.

Click on an intersection to make a move. Left and right arrow keys show the history of the game, while up and down arrows will take you to different branches.
